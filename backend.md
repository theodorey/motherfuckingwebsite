		<h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
		<p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
		<ul>
			<il>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</il>
			<il>Fits on all your shitty screens</il>
			<il>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</il>
			<il>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</il>
			<il>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</il>
